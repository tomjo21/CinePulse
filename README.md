## 📄 Abstract


In the dynamic and competitive film industry, predicting a movie’s success before its release can provide crucial insights for producers, marketers, and distributors. This project presents a machine learning-based system designed to estimate the potential success of a movie based on structured data, including information about the director, cast, genres, budget, and expected viewer ratings.

The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing, including feature extraction, encoding of categorical variables, and normalization. The model was trained using Logistic Regression, with engineered features such as director success rate, actor popularity, and genre distribution proving to be strong indicators of a film’s outcome.

Model performance was assessed through accuracy, precision, and recall, and the results revealed a meaningful alignment between predicted and actual movie success labels. This system illustrates the potential of data-driven approaches in guiding investment decisions and promotional strategies within the entertainment industry.
